# Age of Sigmar Statshammer

A tool for caclulating and comparing damage outputs for Warhammer Age of Sigmar units.

The production deploy of the tool is located at: https://aos-statshammer.herokuapp.com/

The tool works by adding a number of weapon profiles to various units, which can contain
a number of modifiers (abilities)

## Features

- Ability to add multiple units, each with multiple profiles
- The API will then determine the average damage per target save
- Includes a results table and various graphs
- Dark theme
- Persisitent data between refreshes
- Import/Export of unit data
- Ability to export results as PDF
- Ability to add modifiers to the target (e.g: Reroll saves, ethereal, FNP, etc.)

## Roadmap Features

- Ability to add modifiers to the unit as a whole, and not just to each profile
- Ability to provide points costs to provide stats for average damage / 100 points
