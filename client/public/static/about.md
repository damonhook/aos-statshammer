# AoS Statshammer

A tool for calculating and comparing damage outputs for
Warhammer Age of Sigmar units (also referred to as Mathhammer). Some of the features include:

## Average Damage Stats

Gather the average damage that each unit is expected to do against each possible save. This average is a calculated value (not simulated)

## Profile Modifiers

Add various modifiers, or abilities, to your weapon profiles in order to replicate the vast array of unit rules/abilities.
Some examples are: *'Deal `x` Mortal Wounds on a roll of `y`', 'Rerolls', 'Leader Bonuses' etc.*

## Target Modifiers

Add various modifiers, or abilities, to the target to which stats are generated against (the opponents unit).
Some examples are: *'Ethereal', 'Rerolls', 'Negate wounds and mortal wounds on a roll of `y`', etc.*

## Simulations

Generating `x` simulations to gather **Discrete**, and **Cumulative** **Probability**, as well as, various sample metrics (mean, max, variance, etc.).
The number of simulations is customizable from the simulations screen.

## Import/Export JSON

Save your crafted units so that you can re-import them later

## And more

## Notes

This is a free community tool built by Damon Hook (`NoMaDhOoK`)

**Remember:** There is more to a unit than just its damage output. This is a tool, not a definitive answer of which unit is better
